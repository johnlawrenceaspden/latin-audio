You're doing great with vowel length. It's a bit exaggerated, but that's actually a good thing at this stage
- you want to drill into your brain that long vowels and short vowels need to be distinguished by length.

As you progress, a pretty much perfect model for latin long vowels (in terms of relative length, not necessarily in terms of quality) is Japanese.

For instance, here is the word "koko"

and here is the word "kōkō".

Secondly, it sounds like you get the difference between r and rr, which is great - many people exaggerate the single r, making it a trill rather than a tap.

Finally, your vowel qualities are, for the most part, pretty good! There is work to be done, but this is a solid baseline to get to sounding really really good.



Now, onto things that need improvement:

** Fix diphthongization of [ɔ]

Firstly, while you often manage to avoid them, you do have slight diphthongization, particularly of the /o/ vowels. The other vowel English natives tend to diphthongize is /e/ but it sounds like you're doing pretty good with that. Part of this is because your /o/ is a bit high, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when long (some speakers pronounce long /o/ a very high [o] instead of the more open [ɔ] that we prescribe, though pretty much everyone pronounces short /o/ as [ɔ]), but I think it may help with the diphthongization if you open it a bit. The way to get the [ɔ] sound is to take the vowel in the word "cut" (in a General American or Southern English accent... if you're northern English then just mimic a southern accent or an american accent if you can haha) and without moving your tongue/mouth position at all, round your lips. Once you get this, practice extending this sound really long without changing your mouth position at all, and then try putting it into words without any diphthongization. With practice it should become natural.


** lax vowels for short /i/ and /u/

Moving on, you have occasional lax vowels for short /i/ and /u/ - try making a really tight [i] and [u] sound, and then try using that precise sound in short syllables. For instance, try saying "cecidit" many times quickly with all short vowels, but without lowering the /i/ at all. Ditto for "mundus".


** /a/ vowel is too far back

Finally, your /a/ vowel is too far back in the mouth, which I think is part of the reason why your /o/ vowel is being pushed high. In English we have the vowels [ɑ] as in "car", which is the vowel you're using, and [æ] as in "cat", while the vowel you want [a] is directly between the two, which can be tricky for us haha. Here are some recordings of Spanish speakers saying "para" which are perfect models to emulate.


** aspirated consonants

As for consonants, the big thing to work on is aspiration, which is the bane of most English native haha. The best way to go about doing this is to isolate the sounds in words like "spot", "stop", "scott", etc. In English the voiceless stops [p], [t] and [k] are unaspirated when following /s/. In listening to the recordings of these sounds on wikipedia, you may notice that they sound a bit like b, d and g to you - that's because in English, while b, d, g are voiced, the primary distinction to our ears between these sounds and p, t, k is aspiration. This is what makes it tough to teach yourself not to aspirate them haha.

** trouble with /r/

Finally, I've noticed that you have a bit of trouble with /r/ when it's preceded by another consonant - particularly /tr/. Make sure that you're pronouncing the /t/ and the /r/ exactly as they're pronounced individually, rather than as one combined sound. Here's an example of a Spanish speaker saying "tren", in which you can here the unaspirated /t/ directly followed by the tapped /r/.

It may help you to be aware that in all romance languages, and so probably latin as well, /t/ and /d/ are pronounced with the tongue against the back of the top front teeth instead of against the alveolar ridge. This makes it much easier to immediately flick your tongue back to do the alveolar tap afterward, so you might want to practice saying "tempus", "dēns", etc. with the dental /t/ and /d/. Your tongue should be in the same place as where your tongue is when you make the /n/ in the word /tenth/.
