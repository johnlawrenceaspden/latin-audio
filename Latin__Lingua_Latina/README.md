A work in progress! Will be constantly updated and improved while my interest sustains itself. 

The words from Orberg's Familia Romana, with my current best attempt at the Restored Pronunciation 
(In the five-vowels variant proposed by Andrea Calabrese and popularised by Scorpio Martianus 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SizQQ5VwufQbCB9rL-Z3VIUJ) 

Which is to say, our current best guess at how Cicero would have said the words, 
were he a Yorkshireman in the process of learning Latin from Familia Romana.
